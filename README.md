### Resolved Firebase Issue

The error message `Could not resolve all files for configuration ':react-native-firebase_app:androidJdkImage'` indicates that Gradle is unable to find the `core-for-system-modules.jar` file. This file is part of the Android JDK image, which is required to build React Native apps for Android.

The error message also indicates that the `jlink` executable does not exist. This executable is used to create the Android JDK image.

To fix this error, you need to install the Android JDK image and the `jlink` executable.

**To install the Android JDK image:**

1. Download the Android SDK Platform-Tools package from the Android developer website: https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools.
2. Extract the Platform-Tools package to a directory on your computer.
3. Open the `platform-tools` directory in a terminal or command prompt window.
4. Run the following command:

```
android update sdk --no-ui --all
```

This will download and install all of the Android SDK packages that you need to build React Native apps for Android.

**To install the `jlink` executable:**

1. Download the OpenJDK 11 JDK from the OpenJDK website: https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/JDKUpdates/JDK11u.
2. Install the OpenJDK 11 JDK on your computer.
3. Add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
```

This will set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the location of the OpenJDK 11 JDK.

4. Save the changes to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file.
5. Reload your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file by running the following command:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

6. Verify that the `jlink` executable is installed by running the following command:

```
jlink --version
```

If the command is successful, you will see the version of the `jlink` executable.

Once you have installed the Android JDK image and the `jlink` executable, you should be able to build your React Native app without any errors.

Here are some additional things to check:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version of React Native and React Native Firebase.
- Make sure that you have installed all of the required dependencies, including the React Native Firebase SDK and the Android JDK image.
- Try cleaning your build cache by running the following command:

```
react-native clean
```

- Try rebuilding your app from scratch by running the following command:

```
react-native run-android
```

If you are still having trouble building your app, please provide more information about your project setup and the specific errors that you are seeing.
